      Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn 
        and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
        Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that
        can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
      <br>
       <br>Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted 
       to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is,
        methods that leverage data to improve performance on some
         set of tasks.It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
         Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data,
          known as training data, in order to make predictions 
       or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p>
